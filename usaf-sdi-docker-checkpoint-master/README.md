# Docker Checkpoint

Fork and clone this repository!
 
In this repository, you'll find `client`, `server` and `database` applications. These have all been dockerized, and your job is to build out the currently empty `docker-compose.yml` file so that your app can be run with `docker-compose up`.

This bare-bones fullstack app displays a `<div>` whose contents are the result of an
API call from the React app to the Express server, which will render "Welcome to your Dockerized Express/React container!" 

Be sure that you have a viable connection between your database, server, and client applications. Feel free to use Postman or a comparable tool to verify.
